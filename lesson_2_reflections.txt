What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository it create a new folder named .git
	that contain all the metadata and it is need to do it because whit
	this we can add files to the repository and add new commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is the place when files are add in a git add before
	call a commit, the working directory I think is the current state of
	the files.
