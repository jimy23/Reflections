When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    I think when I would stay working in a university project or in personal projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    As I said in a before question, manually would ensure about what is what I want to
    pull and what is not necessary to update.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

    Forks: when I haven't permission to edit on a repository
    Clones: when I want to work in some device or PC.
    Branches: when I decide to improve something to the repository that would be not 
    necessary to add.
    
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    To avoid errors or something that it was make in a previous commit.
    
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what 
would be harder?

    Would be easy to change thinks and repair errors, but would be harder to let know to 
    other people when I did the request.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?

    As I said before, a separate branch will help to explore new ways or improve new
    features and soon as it works it could merge with the master branch. But it is not
    always necessary so work directly in master is the best option.
